    {news: `Maradona at Sevilla: The story of an incident-packed year. Diego Maradona's laces were undone.

    Even when it was virtually done, even when the drugs ban was lifted 15 months after he had left Naples, even as Sevilla FC and Napoli negotiated his transfer, the Italians forced to the negotiating table by FIFA and the Spaniards bankrolled by Silvio Berlusconi's millions, even when it had been all over the media and a plane had set off from Buenos Aires with El Pelusa on board, Sevilla forward Davor Suker didn't believe it. He wouldn't, he said, until Maradona was actually out on the training pitch with them. And that day at last he was, his boots untied.
    
    The things you remember. If there is a detail that has lingered in the mind, an image that those there return to, it is that.
    
    "That first session he went out full of enthusiasm with his boots untied, laces dangling, which isn't a great idea: you fall, you can't hit the ball properly, it's dangerous," then-club-captain Manolo Jimenez tells ESPN. "But not to him. He didn't fall. Instead, there was mastery. He was different."
    
    A crowd had gathered to watch in awe, and that included his new teammates. Diego Armando Maradona, the finest footballer of all time, was actually here at Sevilla Futbol Club. It was 1992, the year of the Expo, the year Spain's first high-speed train reached the city, and now he had too. Seven hundred fifty million pesetas, around $7.5m, brought him back from suspension and back to Spain, the chance for redemption in an unexpected place.`},
